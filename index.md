## About Me

I’m Gabriel Hao Wei Yap, a sophomore Computer Science student at Yonsei University passionate about computer vision, image processing, and human-computer interaction. I enjoy solving technical challenges and developing systems that make technology more intuitive and human-centered. Beyond coding, I’m active in cross-cultural student communities, where I’ve grown as a communicator and leader.
